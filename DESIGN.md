# Aurora Design

Aurora is a lightweight package for logging, querying, and browsing data.

Aurora provides a rich command line interface and web-based GUI for working with all data types. Automatic metadata extraction is provided for a limited set of supported datatypes and new types are easily supported by creating a new data extension.
